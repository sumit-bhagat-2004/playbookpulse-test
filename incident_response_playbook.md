**Responsible:** Development Team  
**Compliance:** SOC 2 CC7.5

- [ ] Fix the root cause of credential exposure
- [ ] Deploy security patches if applicable
- [ ] Implement additional safeguards (secrets manager, etc.)
- [ ] Verify fix with security team

---

## 6. Recovery Phase

### Step 9: Service Restoration
**Timeline:** Based on severity  
**Responsible:** SRE Team  
**Compliance:** NIST SP 800-61 Â§3.5.1

- [ ] Gradually restore database access
- [ ] Monitor for anomalies during restoration
